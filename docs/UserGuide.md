--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `tApp.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your tApp.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`students`** : Lists all students.

    * **`addStudent`**`n/Tom Lim e/tom@u.nus.edu s/A0123456B` : Adds a student named `Tom Lim` to the student list.

    * **`deleteStudent`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

    * **`clearStudents`** : Deletes all students.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addStudent n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/cs` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/year2`, `t/year2 t/cs` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME s/STUDENT_NUMBER`, `s/STUDENT_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `s/A0221393L s/A0114938H`, only `s/A0114938H` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `students`, `exit` and `clearStudents`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

## Students
### List all students: `students`

Shows a list of all students inputted into tApp together with their attendance and participation scores for tutorials.

Format: `students`

Examples:
* `students` returns a list of all students with their information and attendance scores

### Add a student : `addStudent`

Adds a student to the student list.

Format: `addStudent n/NAME e/EMAIL s/STUDENTNUMBER [u/GITHUB USERNAME] [r/REPO NAME] [t/TAG]...`

* GitHub link will only be shown if both `GITHUB USERNAME` and `REPO NAME` are specified.
* `STUDENTNUMBER` must consist of a character, followed by 7 digits, followed by another character.
  Case of character does not matter.
* `EMAIL` must be of the form `local-part@domain` where
  * `local-part` should only contain alphanumeric characters and `+_.-`, and cannot start or end with `+_.-`.
  * `domain` is made up of `domain labels` separated by periods and must:
    - end with a `domain label` at least 2 characters long
    - have each `domain label` start and end with alphanumeric characters
    - have each `domain label` consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any
* If only either `GITHUB USERNAME` or `REPO NAME` are specified, the data will still be saved but not shown.
* If the same person is edited and the remaining empty data field is entered, a proper GitHub link will be shown.

Examples:
* `addStudent n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com s/A0123456B u/user r/ip t/friends t/owesMoney` adds John Doe to the list
  and displays a confirmation output with a proper GitHub link
* `addStudent n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com s/A0123456B u/user` adds John Doe to the list and displays a confirmation
  output without a proper GitHub link, but storing the `GITHUB USERNAME` in memory nonetheless.

### Edit a student : `editStudent`

Edits an existing student in the students list.

Format: `editStudent INDEX [n/NAME] [s/STUDENT_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [r/REPO_NAME] [u/USERNAME] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the student’s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.
* This command flags out missing fields first before ensuring the validity of the fields, and finally the index. (If an invalid index is entered with no or wrong fields, the command would not check the validity of the index)

Examples:
* `editStudent 1 s/A0221111L e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the student number and email address of the 1st person to be `A0221111L` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

* The index must refer to the index number shown in the displayed students list.
* The index and week number must be a positive number, and must correspond to the tutorial weeks of the semester: 3, 4... 12.
* Duplicate index(es) are not allowed.  
* If the student at the specified `INDEX` is marked as present, the command toggles the attendance to absent.

Examples:

* `students` followed by `marka 1 2 3 w/3` marks the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person in the students list as present in week 3.
* Another `marka 1 w/3` instance will mark the 1st person in the student list as absent in week 3.

### Marking a student's participation: `markp`

Marks the specified student(s) in the student list as participated or not participated.

Format: `markp INDEX [MORE_INDEXES] w/WEEK_NUMBER`

* Marks the person(s) as participated in the specified `INDEX` for that week.
